# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> One part of the code that was relatively easy to understand was the overall goal of the module. At the end of the day, it was a call to the megabus site 
> to retrieve bus tickets with certain parameters. The part that made it difficult to understand was the usage of Promises and syntax I was not used to.
> For example, the "=>" operator was used when creating a new function, and a few of the functions returned "Promises" which was a concept
> I wasn't familiar with. But in order to learn the library, I just went a wrote little comments to myself on the different functions, and basically
> followed the "story" that the code was telling. 


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> "Raising the level of abstraction" means being able to look at the overall goal of a function or operation. Sometimes the implementation
> details are irrelevant to the overall goal. For a new CSE student I would describe the zoom function of a camera. You can zoom in really close 
> on a photo. But as you zoom out once, twice, thrice, etc. you begin to see the full picture and the 'bigger picture' if you will. But if you are 
> zoomed in, you only have a small view of what is going on. I would say that when commenting, give a bigger picture of just the important things
> that are necessary such as the iputs and outputs. CSE is hard enough without being bogged down by intimate details :) 


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> It took me 2-3 hours to sift through the npm modules. It then took me another 2-3 hours to understand the code and write the documentation. 


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I only received help from Joel during office hours.  


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> No significant problems! I thought it was an interesting assignment, one that I've never had to do before and it was nice to reverse-think.
